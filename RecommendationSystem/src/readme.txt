Project: SVDBasedRecommendation

This project utilizes some packages from Apache Mahout (http://mahout.apache.org) to implement SVD algorithm and KMeans clustering.

Java File:

1. Reformat.java
Reformat the original data file and normalize all the ratings.

2. AVGRating.java
Generate each user's average value of all ratings.

3. GaussianMatrix.java
Generate a Gaussian Matrix File "GaussianMatrix.txt" used in Randomized SVD Algorithm.

4. RandomizedSVD.java
Perform randomized SVD algorithm.

5. PreKMeans.java
According the matrix V after randomized SVD algorithm, generate the input file for KMeans Clustering.

6. DisplayKMeans.java
Perform KMeans algorithm.

7. PreSimilarity.java
According to the original data, generate the input file for computing all the similarity values.

8. Similarity.java
Generate all the similarity values for each two users in the same cluster.

9. MyRecommend.java
Make rating predictions and recommendations for all the users.

Input Data File:

data.txt: It saves the original data.

GaussianMatrix.txt: It is generated by running GaussianMatix.java, and it is the input file of RandomizedSVD.

dataForKMeans: It is generated by running PreKMeans.java, and it is the input file of DisplayKMeans.

KMeansResult: It is the result of running DisplayKMeans.java.
